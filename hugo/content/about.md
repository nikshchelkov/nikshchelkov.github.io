I focus on analytics engineering, stakeholder-ready BI, ML pipelines, and pragmatic AI agent prototypes designed for constrained environments.



Core strengths

\- Power BI semantic modeling and DAX

\- ML pipeline design, evaluation, interpretability

\- RAG and tool-calling prototypes with logging and guardrails
